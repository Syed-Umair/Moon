> "The goal of the build is balance,
    I dont build for others, I build for me.
    It takes time to realize the dream, to turn it into reality.
    It doesn't matter in which environment you develop. Linux, Macintosh or Windows.
    All that matters is you.
    Does it please you or does it not."
